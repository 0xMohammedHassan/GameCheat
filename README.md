Cheat for Spyro The Dragon.

I coded this cheat with c++ ,  
it worked with pSX v1.13 emulator , you can edit any emualator you want in the source , the logic for this cheat is to edit 0x0DD42FE8 address
to increase the chest amount , it has 2 mode's  first one is:
Static mode:
-By using the variable var1 and write it to the address so it will increment the amount based on var1 value for once.
Dynamic mode:
-By pressing on the key "TAB" it will increase the amount of chests based on var1 each time you pressed on TAB key.
